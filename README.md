## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
NovusCLI is a lite version of the full Novus package manager (Coming later this year) that allows users to start with a simple syntax, for their favorite APT package manager.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Getting started for contributing to NovusCLI is very easy, you just need to follow the instructions below if you wish to build from source.

### Prerequisites
In order to start building NovusCLI, you are going to need to have rustup and cargo installed (Installing rustup automatically installs cargo so just worry about rustup). You can get rustup [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install/).

Without [APT](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/) (Linux) or [MacPT](https://github.com/Official-polar-team/MacPT/) (macOS) it's useless though so be sure to install what fits for your system!

## Building

* cd into the nvs directory (You can easily do so by opening the terminal typing ```cd``` and dragging and dropping the nvs folder into the terminal window and clicking the enter key).
* Run ```cargo build --release``` in the terminal.
* Make sure your in the nvs directory and from there go into the target directory and then go into the release directory (nvs --> target --> release).
* You should see a executable file named "nvs" without the "".
* Congratulations! You have successfully built NovusCLI (nvs)!

## Installing
### Using MacPT

* If you have MacPT installed on your machine you just have to make sure you have the Serna repository on your machine. To check run ```sudo apt edit-sources``` and press enter, (If you have a password set on your Mac it will ask you to input your password, when you type it won't show you're typing but you are typing so just type your password and click the enter key) if you get an error it's most likely because you don't have a nano installed, [click here](#building-and-installing-nano) and follow the tutorial to install nano.
* After entering ```sudo apt edit-sources``` you should see ```deb https://sernarepo.com/macos georgia main``` on it's own line in there. If you don't see it there then add it! To save your changes press the Control + O without the + and then click enter and to exit press Control + X without the +.
* If you didn't see the repository there and you had to manually add it then type ```sudo apt update``` in your terminal and click enter (If you have a password set on your mac it will ask you to input your password, when you type it won't show you're typing but you are typing so just type your password and click the enter key).
* Now type ```sudo apt install novuscli```
* Congratulations! You have successfully installed NovusCLI (nvs)!

#### Building and Installing Nano

* [Click here](https://nano-editor.org/download.php/) to go download the nano source (I recommend the tar.xz one)
* Go to the folder it was downloaded to (By default it downloads to ~/Downloads but if you changed the directory where files * download then just go there).
* Extract the nano source you downloaded.
* Open your terminal
* Type ```cd``` then drag and drop the folder you extracted and click enter.
* run ```./configure```.
* run ```make```.
* run ```sudo make install```

### Manually

* If you haven't already go build NovusCLI, for instructions on that [clicking here](#Building).
* Make sure where the application name is displayed on the mac's top bar that is says ```Finder```, if it doesn't click on your desktop background or the finder icon on your dock. After doing so hold the keyboard shortcut Command + Shift + G a text field asking for a file path should appear (If anything is in the field clear it) in that text field type ```/usr/local/bin/``` and click enter.
* Drag the nvs binary you got from compiling novus in the window that just popped up.
* Congratulations! You have successfully installed NovusCLI (nvs)! Without [APT](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/) (Linux) or [MacPT](https://github.com/Official-polar-team/MacPT/) (macOS) it's useless though so be sure to install what fits for your system!
